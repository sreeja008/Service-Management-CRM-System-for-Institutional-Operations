EduConsultPro Institute, a premier educational institution offering diverse courses and programs, encountered significant challenges in managing its growing number of
student inquiries, admission processes, and expert consulting services. To address these challenges, a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application was developed
using Salesforce. The primary objective of this project was to streamline the admission process, providing a seamless and transparent experience for prospective students, while
enabling admissions staff to manage applications, inquiries, and case management efficiently. The CRM application integrates and automates key processes, enhancing
operational efficiency and optimizing the workflow. This solution not only improves the user experience for students but also empowers the institution's staff to deliver timely
and effective services, thereby supporting EduConsultPro's mission to offer exceptional educational opportunities.
